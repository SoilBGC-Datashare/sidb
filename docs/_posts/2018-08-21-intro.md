The code below gives an example on how to use the R package provided with the database, and how to use it for queries.

# Install package and load the database into an R session

{% highlight R %}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('SoilBGC-Datashare/sidb/Rpkg')
{% endhighlight %}


Once the package is installed we need to loaded with the command

```R
library(sidb)
```

Now we can load all database entries into an R session

```
allentries=loadEntries(path="~/sidb/data/")
```

Now, all database entries are available in one single object: `loadentries`. It is an R list that can be queried using standard R sintax. In particular, the R functions `lapply` or `sapply` can be used to extract information from the entries.
