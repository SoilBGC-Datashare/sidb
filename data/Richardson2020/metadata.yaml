incubationInfo:
        incDesc: "Soil incubations were performed over a 90-day period. Air dried soils were passed through a 2mm sieve and packed into a 75cm3 ring. The filled rings were then placed on permeable pressure plates fitted with water-filled
bladders. The permeable plates with rings were placed in pressure chambers for 24-hrs, bringing the soil water content to -10kPa, a standard field capacity value for Oxisols. 15g 105℃
oven-dry equivalent, -10kPa moist soil was then transferred to a 125mL incubation chamber with septa for sampling. Sealed, filled incubation chambers were placed in an incubator set to
maintain 25℃. Prior to each sampling event, headspace was mixed three times using a 10mL syringe. When taking samples, 6mL of mixed headspace were taken through the septa of the closed
incubation chambers using a 10mL syringe and transferred into an Exetainer evacuated to 1.5-2 atmospheres. Incubation chambers were aired out for one hour following each sampling event and then resampled for ambient CO2 levels. Ambient CO2 were also taken using a 10mL
syringe, purging three times prior to sampling. 6mL of ambient air was transferred to a separate Exetainer for CO2 quantification. Exetainers filled with respiration and ambient headspace were analyzed for CO2 concentration (PPM). on a Perkin Elmer Gas Chromatograph
(PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA). Samples were collected from experimental plots planted with 2 different cane varieities. Each cane variety had 2 irrigation trials (standard irrigation or deficit of 50 percent)"  # Short description of the incubation setup and main treatments
