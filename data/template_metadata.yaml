          activeLayer: # Depth of the active layer in meters

incubationInfo:
        incDesc: # Short description of the incubation setup and main treatments
# These fields should all be one dimensional arrays. Values for experimental variables with multiple treatment levels should be entered in the variables section and left blank here
        depthInfo: # Soil depth in cm. If only one depth listed instead of range, enter as midDepth. By default 0 is defined as organic/mineral interface. If reported otherwise enter "yes" under the surfaceAtm field. If multiple depths analyzed leave blank and specify depths in variables section.
          top:
          bottom:
          midDepth:
          surfaceAtm: # blank if zero is organic/mineral interface, yes if zero is atmospheric interface
          horizon: # soil horizon designation
        temperature: # Temperature at which incubations were performed in Celsius. If temperature is an experimental treatment with multiple levels leave blank and specify in variables section
        moisture: # Moisture conditions at which incubations were performed.
          value: # If moisture is an experimental treatment with multiple levels leave blank and specify in variables section
          units: # Valid fields are: percentGWC, percentFieldCapacity, percentWaterFilledPoreSpace
        treatmentName: # This is a placeholder for any additional treatments performed, and follows the same pattern as 'moisture', above.
          value: # specify value for treatment, e.g. `glucose` for priming experiment. If treatment has multiple levels leave blank and specify in variables section
          units: # specify units for treatment value, e.g. 'mgC/g soilC' for glucose
        anaerobic: # Yes if headspace flushed with N2 or He, blank if aerobic
        gasMeasured: # Blank if CO2, Other valid entries are: CH4, N2O, 13CO2, 14CO2, 13CH4, etc. Leave blank if multiple gases measured and specify in variables section

          site: # Site where the incubated sample was collected
          experimentalTreatment: # 'experimentalTreatment' here is a place holder for treatments with multiple levels. Replace this word by any of the listed variables in incubationInfo above (temperature, moisture, etc.) and type treatment value (level) after colon. Note that units should be specified in the incubationInfo field above.
          gasMeasured: # Blank if CO2, Other valid fields are: CH4, N2O, 13CO2, 14CO2, 13CH4, etc
