incubationInfo:
    incDesc: "Soil respiration rates were determined through periodic analysis of CO2 concentration of headspace gas samples using a LI-COR 6525"
    depthInfo: # Soil depth. If only one depth listed instead of range, enter as top and bottom, 0 is organic/mineral interface. If organic layer, enter 0 as top and bottom. If multiple depths, use an array.
      top: # in cm
      bottom: # in cm
      midDepth: #average depth
      surfaceAtm: # blank if zero is organic/mineral interface, yes if surface is atmospheric interfacelaboratoryTreatment: # List of laboratory treatments applied to the incubations (e.g., temperature, moisture, etc.)
      horizon: # soil horizon designation
    temperature:
    moisture:
