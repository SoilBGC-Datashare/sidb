#These do not have to be arrays of equal length to site array
        depthInfo: # Soil depth. If only one depth listed instead of range, enter as top and bottom, 0 is organic/mineral interface. If organic layer, enter 0 as top, bottom, and midDepth. If multiple depths, use an array.

          bottom: 10
          midDepth: 5
          surfaceAtm: # blank if zero is organic/mineral interface, yes if surface is atmospheric interface
          horizon: # soil horizon designation

          activeLayer: # Depth of the active layer in meters

incubationInfo:
        description: "Soil incubated at 5, 15, and 25 for 28 d. Two 2-way designs were performed (temperature x N (NH4) and temperature x C (glucose))."
        temperature: # Overall temperature at which incubations were performed in Celsius. If temperature is an experimental treatment, leave blank.
        moisture:
          value: 30
          units: percentGWC
        anaerobic: # Yes if headspace flushed with N2 or He, blank if aerobic
        gasMeasured: #  Blank if CO2, Other valid fields are: CH4, N2O, 13CO2, 14CO2, 13CH4, etc
        laboratoryTreatment: # List of laboratory treatments applied to the incubations (e.g., temperature, moisture, amendments, etc.)
