incubationInfo:
       desc: "16 cores were transferred to an incubator (MIR-153) set at 2 deg. Of these 16 cores, 10 were maintained at 2 deg for 90 days (high–low treatment), and the other 6 cores were returned to the 10 deg incubator after 60 days at 2 deg (high–low–high treatment). Remaining 10 cores were maintained at10 deg for the whole 200-day incubation (constant high treatment)"
