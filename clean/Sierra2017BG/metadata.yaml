  soilTaxonomy:
        soilOrder: Inceptisol # Soil order according to the classification system described below
        soilFamily:   Histic  Pergelic  Cryaquep # Soil family description (e.g., Eutric of Eutric Cambisol)
        soilSeries: Gilmore silt loam # Soil series according to the classification system described below
        classificationSystem: USDA # Name of classification system used. Valid fields are: USDA, FAO, and WRB.

  depthInfo: # Soil depth. If only one depth listed instead of range, enter as top and bottom, 0 is organic/mineral interface. If organic layer, enter 0 as top and bottom. If multiple depths, use an array.
          top: 0 # in cm
          bottom: 20 # in cm
          midDepth: 10 #average depth
          surfaceAtm: # blank if zero is organic/mineral interface, yes if surface is atmospheric interfacelaboratoryTreatment: # List of laboratory treatments applied to the incubations (e.g., temperature, moisture, etc.)
          horizon: A # soil horizon designation
  permafrost:
          permafrostExist: Yes # Yes or No (if yes, permafrost must exist at the site)
          activeLayer: 0.2 # Depth of the active layer in meters
  experimentalTreatment: # List of experimental treatments applied at the site level, midDepths if multiple depths incubated, or locations/profiles within sites

incubationInfo:
  description: "Full factorial incubation experiment with the manipulated treatments being temperature (25, 35 C), soil water content (15, 30, 60 90% water-filled pore space), and oxygen concentration in the pore space (1 and 20%), with soils enclosed in PVC cylinders (10 cm diameter and 20 cm height) containing in about half of their volume 450 g of homogenized soil. The approximate bulk density within each cylinder was 0.6 g cm-3. Organic soil was collected from the A horizon of a boreal forest dominated by black spruce at the Caribou Poker watershed in central Alaska, USA"
  temperature: # Overall temperature at which incubations were performed in Celsius. If temperature is an experimental treatment, leave blank.
  moisture:
    value: # Overall moisture at which incubations were performed. If moisture is an experimental treatment, leave blank.
    units: # Valid fields are: percentGWC or percentFieldCapacity
  anaerobic: Yes # Yes if headspace flushed with N2 or He, blank if aerobic
  gasMeasured: #  Blank if CO2, Other valid fields are: CH4, N2O, 13CO2, 14CO2, 13CH4, etc
