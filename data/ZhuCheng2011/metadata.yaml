siteInfo: 
        study: "Constant versus diurnal-varying temperature lead to different temp sensitivity"
        site: UC Santa Cruz
#These fields should be arrays of equal length to site array       
        coordinates:
          latitude: 36.983626
          longitude: -122.055460
        country: USA
        MAT: # Mean annual temperature in degrees Celsius
