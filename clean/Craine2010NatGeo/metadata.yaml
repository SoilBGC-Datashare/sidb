incubationInfo:
        description: 'We adjusted seven replicates of 20 g dry-equivalent soil to 35% water-holding capacity and placed them in 50 ml polyethylene centrifuge tubes. Replicates were then incubated at 20 _C. Periodically, the five replicates for each soil were sealed with a cap containing a rubber septum, and then distributed over five temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 _C). Two additional replicates were maintained at 20 _C. These soils were incubated for 18_72 h and then respiration rates for each determined by removing 4 ml of gas. They were then injected in-line into a N2 gas stream and the peak heights measured with a Licor 6252 infrared gas analyser. Using a set of calibrations, peak heights were converted to CO2 concentrations in the tubes and then to respiration rates that were scaled relative to soil organic C' # Short description of the incubation setup and main treatments
