siteInfo:
        study: 'Stability of organic carbon in deep soil layers controlled by fresh carbon supply' # Overall study description
        site: Massif # Names of individual sites, if one site, keep on this line, if multiple, use array format
#These fields should be arrays of equal length to site array
        coordinates:
          latitude: 45.1 # Latitude in decimal units (check for negative that denotes southern hemisphere)
          longitude: 2.7 # Longitude in decimal units (check for negative that denotes west)
        country: France # Name of country where site was conducted
        MAT: # Mean annual temperature in degrees Celsius
        MAP: # Mean annual precipitation in mm
        elevation: # Elevation of study site in meters above sea levels
        landCover: rangeland/grassland # Land cover of the site. Valid fields are: bare, cultivated, forest, rangeland/grassland, shrubland, urban, wetland, tundra
        vegNote: grassland for >50 years, chestnut and hornbeam forest 2000 ya #Additional details about land cover such as species or functional type composition
        soilTaxonomy:
          soilOrder: Cambisol # Soil order according to the classification system described below
          soilFamily: # Soil family description (e.g., Eutric of Eutric Cambisol)
          soilSeries: # Soil series according to the classification system described below
          classificationSystem: WRB # Name of classification system used. Valid fields are: USDA, FAO, and WRB.
#These do not have to be arrays of equal length to site array
        depthInfo: # Soil depth. If only one depth listed instead of range, enter as top and bottom, 0 is organic/mineral interface. If organic layer, enter 0 as top, bottom, and midDepth. If multiple depths, use an array.
          top: 60 # in cm
          bottom: 80 # in cm
          midDepth: 70 #average depth
          surfaceAtm:  # blank if zero is organic/mineral interface, yes if surface is atmospheric interface
          horizon: # soil horizon designation
        permafrost:
          permafrostExist: no # yes or no (if yes, permafrost must exist at the site)
          activeLayer: # Depth of the active layer in meters
        experimentalTreatment: # List of experimental treatments applied at the site level, midDepths if multiple depths incubated, or locations/profiles within sites
