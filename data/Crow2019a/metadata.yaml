          "25g oven-dry equivalent sample of air-dried soil was rewetted to 60% water holding capacity, placed into a 610 mL airtight container
          at a controlled temperature. Soils were sampled on different days depending on the amount of CO2 acumulating to avoid concentration over 7K ppm.
          After sampling, headspace was purged, caps resealed, intitial concentration taken, then left to accumulate."
