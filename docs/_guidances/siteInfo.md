Site characteristics provide a context for the inherent, pre-incubation
conditions of the soils. General site characteristics, such as latitude
and longitude, as well as mean annual temperature and mean annual
precipitation, are important in drawing out similarities and differences
between studies. Descriptions of the ecosystem and the aboveground
vegetation give information on litter input and chemistry, which can be
a direct link to organic matter quality. Additionally, providing the
full soil taxonomy helps to put findings into context with other studies
(Schimel and Chadwick, 2013). When reporting the sampling depth, it is
necessary to report whether the depth is in relation to the soil surface
or within a specific soil horizon and whether samples are taken from a
generic horizon or represent a mixture of several horizons (when sampled
to a certain depth). Additionally, specifics of the geography and
topography of the sampling locations, such as permafrost zone, active
layer thickness, or permafrost table are crucial to report.
